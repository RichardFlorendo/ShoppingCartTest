# ShoppingCartTest
This is the progress I accomplished for a shopping cart application as an assessment test.

# Description

This project is the culumination of the task assigned to me, done to the best of my abilities, for an assessment task I was asked to perform.

It is a Shopping Cart application coded in Java, with JSON reading and parsing, recyclerviews, and UI as close to the sample as possible.
